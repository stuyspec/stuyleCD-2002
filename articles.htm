              by Candace Nuzzo<br>
              Opinions writers become opinions writers because they want to be 
              heard, regardless if it's interesting or not. Student Union officials 
              join the SU because they want to affect the school, whether it's 
              possible to do so or not. Spectator staff writers, editors and contributing 
              writers have had a rather inconsistent attitude toward the SU over 
              the past four years, at times praising its efforts, and at others 
              criticizing its actions. Nevertheless, The Spectator opinions page 
              is often where the two groups come together to impart their influence 
              on the student body.<br>

              by Eugene Oh and Christina Shin<br>
              The Stuyvesant lunchroom's head chef, Andreas Skouras, has been 
              bustling through from the kitchen to the serving lines to the oversized 
              ovens and refrigerators behind the scenes in the section of the 
              cafeteria unknown to most of Stuyvesant's students for more almost 
              ten years. He arrives at school everyday at 7:00 AM and checks each 
              type of food for their proper temperatures in each respective refrigerator. 
              At 7:30, Skouras' two assistants arrive to begin preparation for 
              the day's cooking. The salads are tossed, the tomatoes are sliced 
              and the sandwiches wrapped and another day of Stuyvesant lunch begins.

              It is rare when an issue raised in The Spectator fails to elicit 
              at least one response from some reader within the Stuyvesant community, 
              be it a student, a teacher, a parent, or an alumnus. Some topics 
              of concern, however, not only elicit a response, but spark written 
              debates on the Opinions pages that last for several issues. At least 
              two such discussions have occurred in the past four years: cheating 
              and censorship.<br>

              by Jane Pae<br>
              Getting in was as hard as getting out is going to be. Now the terror 
              of navigating ten floors and finding new friends is as easy to relive 
              as the fear of yesterday's calculus test or seeing your designated 
              assassin waiting for you outside the classroom. The jump from Freshman 
              Friday to Killer hints at the four distinct worlds that rest between 
              the four walls at 345 Chambers Street. They may coexist relatively 
              smoothly, but each is easily distinguished. The experience of each 
              grade is embodied in a quintessential album. Although not all four 
              recordings that chronicle our high school career were released during 
              it, they were chosen according to content to match emotion, pecking 
              order in the artist's discography, and of course quality. So sit 
              back, pop them into the stereo, and let the good/bad/ok times roll--again.<br>

              by Max Willens<br>
              Every year, in the warm sunlight of September, the Student Union 
              lounge is clean, freshly painted, and serene. Tables and couches 
              are arranged in a way that will promote discourse and conversation. 
              A few days before school starts, Jukay Hsu walks briskly in and 
              out of his office, whistling with purpose. In a matter of months, 
              the floors will be caked with something sticky, the couches that 
              have remained intact will be full of M&amp;Ms, dust, and in some 
              cases, mice. The tables are being used as foot rests or card tables, 
              and a few minutes after second period has started, as Mr. Teitel 
              barges in, and croaks out an angry demand for program cards, a few 
              sleepy-eyed seniors will either fumble for their wallets, or mumble 
              something about not hearing the bell, and excuse themselves. <br>

              When arthritis has attacked our joints and gray hairs have sprung 
              up on our heads, we may find ourselves looking back on our high 
              school years, trying to use whatever we've kept to remind us of 
              those years of youth and beauty. Given the near omnipresence of 
              music in our lives these days, songs are now as nostalgia-inspiring 
              as snapshots. The opening notes of a song or the bridge in a ballad 
              can bring waves of memory back as quickly as an old letter or even 
              a Polaroid of best friends on a beach. What follows is a year by 
              year breakdown of songs to listen to when, in the dimness of a study, 
              hunched over a dusty scrap book, you get the urge to remember what 
              it sounded like to be young too. <br>

by Abby Deutsch<br>
              It is quiet in a sun-filled room on the tenth floor. Pens scratch 
              on paper and a student looks up, squints, and sighs. Poetry teacher 
              Emily Moore grins slightly, prepared to squirt any reluctant writer 
              with water from her plastic fish.<br>
