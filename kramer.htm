              <b>Spectator: What, if anything, do you actually do?</b><br>
              Kramer: I take up space&#133;. and collect pay. When things break, 
              blame it on underlings. When the underlings fix it, I take credit.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Do you like computers? </b><br>
              Kramer: Computers are the agents of Satan.<br>
              <b><br>
              </b></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spectator: 
              Elaborate.</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Kramer: Computers purport to be timesaving devices, but in actuality 
              turn out to be black holes into which your time disappears--and 
              nothing comes out.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Do you enjoy using them in your spare time?</b><br>
              Kramer: Yeah, I do. [smiles, sheepishly] I love the ability to write 
              a program and accomplish something.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: There have been scattered reports that you're something 
              of an American hero. Confirm or deny?</b><br>
              Kramer: Well, yeah, I'm one of the great people of my generation. 
              But, I'm modest&#133; probably too modest. For example, there have 
              been plenty of times where I could have killed someone with my car--
              and I didn't.<br>
              <b><br>
              </b></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spectator: 
              Who is the strangest person you've met in your time at Stuyvesant?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Kramer: [Longish pause as Kramer thinks] There was this student 
              who wanted to be God. Her mother was a Nazi (really, she was) and 
              when the girl was a freshman, she wanted to be God. By the time 
              she was a senior, she had become much more realistic, and all she 
              wanted was to become King of the World.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Who's your favorite staff member?</b><br>
              Kramer: My secretary Angela. She's just wonderful. And Kioko. I'm 
              just really lucky to work with those two, they're very fine people.<br>
              <b><br>
              </b></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spectator: 
              What's your opinion of cafeteria food?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Kramer: [Laughs] When I go to the cafeteria, I accuse them of crimes 
              against humanity. I say to them &quot;just because this is your 
              job doesn't excuse what you're doing. The Nuremberg defense didn't 
              fly in post-war Germany and it certainly doesn't fly here.&quot; 
              It's hard to know what food groups are being represented. When I 
              do eat up there, I get the tuna salad, because the chances of getting 
              food poisoning from that are lower than anything else.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What do you think of Stuyvesant students?<br>
              </b>Kramer: Stuyvesant Students are the one constant here. They're 
              great. What makes this school great isn't the building, it isn't 
              the staff--it's the students.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: After 34 years. What are your thoughts on the state 
              of the public education in New York City?</b><br>
              Kramer: I would have said, 30 years ago, that the Board of Education 
              was so inefficient that it couldn't get worse. Boy, was I naive. 
              Especially since I've been dealing with technology at Stuyvesant. 
              I've seen systemic waste, incompetence, and stupidity at a staggering 
              level.<br>
              <b><br>
              Spectator: Any hope?</b><br>
              Kramer: No hope. Unless the Board of Education is completely done 
              away with and the people who know how to manage build the system 
              from the ground up. [Points to a poster on the wall, depicting BOE 
              seal reading &quot;Aliquid Carissimum Est] Whatever costs the most. 
              The Board is completely paternalistic, from the top down. A salmon 
              has a better chance of swimming up Niagara Falls than a thought 
              does of reaching the twelfth floor of Livingston Street [the headquarters 
              of the Board of Education]. [Laughs] It's a good thing I'm retiring.</font></p>

              <b>Spectator: Any last words?</b><br>
              Kramer: Yeah. I feel truly blessed to have worked here for all these 
              years. When I think back on these thirty years, I remember the kids. 
              I don't expect to leave here dry-eyed.</font></p>
