            Stuyvesant's &quot;Secret Strength&quot;</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
            <b>by ABIGAIL DEUTSCH<br>
            <br>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
            is quiet in a sun-filled room on the tenth floor. Pens scratch on 
            paper and a student looks up, squints, and sighs. Poetry teacher Emily 
            Moore grins slightly, prepared to squirt any reluctant writer with 
            water from her plastic fish.<br>
            <br>
            Poets persevere through the most trying times, and this term has tested 
            Stuyvesant's writers. In the absence of English teachers Judith Hawk 
            and Douglas Goetsch, who left Stuyvesant permanently after last year, 
            and Katherine Fletcher, who is on maternity leave, Moore teaches the 
            only creative writing class this term. Nonetheless, students continue 
            to make their mark in the writing world--though the rest of the school 
            may not know it.<br>
            <br>
            Writing is Stuyvesant's &quot;secret strength,&quot; said Fletcher; 
            while Intel finalists receive &quot;so much attention, every year 
            writers win thousands of dollars in scholarships, but they get no 
            attention.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            But English teacher Annie Thoms said that while she would like &quot;to 
            see more of an appreciation of writing,&quot; it is &quot;more on 
            its way than in previous years.&quot; And Moore, who came to Stuyvesant 
            this year, has found teaching poetry here &quot;amazing.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            &quot;It's an incredibly smart and driven school, and it's a really 
            exciting school,&quot; she said. &quot;The intellectual and creative 
            freedoms offered here are amazing. It's so big that you can run poetry, 
            three fiction classes, one American Short Stories.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Fletcher added that students are &quot;incredibly smart, creative 
            thinkers.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Writing is a way to counteract the often stressful Stuyvesant experience. 
            &quot;Students can go through all their classes and not be heard or 
            seen as a result of class size or the set curriculum,&quot; Moore 
            said. &quot;In writing classes I try to see the student and really 
            hear what they're saying, why they have that opinion--it's not just 
            about the right answer. Writing nurtures something that needs to be 
            addressed.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Fletcher said writing helps students &quot;find their voices&quot; 
            in a school whose size can make them feel voiceless. &quot;It's very 
            hard to feel you matter as an individual when you're one of 3,000,&quot; 
            she said. Writing classes are &quot;an outlet that Stuy students might 
            not find elsewhere, where everything they have to say does matter.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Hearing students is vital to the process of reading and grading student 
            poetry, according to Moore. &quot;The first and most important thing 
            is that I hear what they're saying, the unusual and emotive thing, 
            and I write, 'I love this evocation of spring or loss,' so the student 
            knows I've heard them.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Senior Dina Mishra, who is co-editor in chief of the literary magazine 
            Caliper, agreed that writing stands apart from the rest of the Stuyvesant 
            experience. &quot;Writing hasn't been tainted by the numbers game 
            at Stuy,&quot; she said, adding that the best thing about her writing 
            class was &quot;the whole idea of muutual respect, of not being in 
            competition with your classmates.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Junior Katarzyna Kozanecka, who has won awards for her poetry, cited 
            &quot;the stress on measuring knowledge through multiple choice tests, 
            the calculator-oriented way of assigning grades&quot; as detractatory 
            from the creative mind. <br>
            <br>
            In the creative writing classes she took as was a Stuyvesant student, 
            Thoms said that it was okay &quot;to write about things that mattered 
            and were important to you and shaped who you were. I found myself 
            getting to know [my classmates] unlike in any other classes&quot; 
            as she read and responded to their writing. <br>
            <br>
            The greatest gift, Thoms said, was &quot;confidence in my own creativity.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Another advantage of writing, Kozanecka said, is &quot;the feeling 
            that I can effect change--I choose my words. Writing has given me 
            a reason to study all other subjects. As I become more of a writer 
            I look for more meaning in my classes. I look for concepts that I 
            can apply to the greater planet. Through writing I hope to improve 
            my country Poland, and to improve my country I need some knowledge 
            of all subject areas.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In the vein of integrating different subject matter, she added, &quot;The 
            reason I'm taking calculus next year, besides parental pressure, is: 
            I hope to find poetry in math! I want it all to come together!&quot; 
            <br>
            <br>
            Writing classes make people better all-around English students, the 
            teachers said. Fletcher said she strives for her students to read 
            as writers--to view published writers as colleagues who grapple with 
            the same choices novice writers do. Then, she said, &quot;you understand 
            literature better, and you understand your own writing better.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Thoms said the focus on language she pursued in creative writing classes 
            improved her as a creative writer, an essayist, and a thinker.<br>
            <br>
            Aside from classes, Caliper, the literary magazine, Writing on the 
            Wall, which publishes student prose and poetry under glass cases in 
            hallways, and Open Mics provide additional outlets. Senior Emily Claman 
            organizes Wednesday workshop sessions in a SoHo cafe. <br>
            <br>
            Students' poems have been a pleasure--and a surprise. &quot;The writers 
            at the school are so good,&quot; said Moore, who used to be a poetry 
            reader at the New Yorker. &quot;Here I found very sophisticated style, 
            the ideas are unusual, the feelings are deep, the form is at a high 
            level.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Mishra said student writing was sometimes so brilliant that upon reading 
            it she would think, &quot;I could have seen this in a book.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The best thing about poetry in general is that students write 
            in so many different voices,&quot; Moore said, adding, &quot;and sometimes 
            something works, but you don't know why it works.&quot;<br>

                          In the back row of our day's end<br>
                          math class, he watched me try <br>
                          to pull my hair out but it was all <br>
                          gone from other frustrations. <br>
                          Grinning, <br>
                          he leaned over and plucked <br>
                          the thorn from my side. <br>
                          His Star of David knocked <br>
                          against my notebook as he traced <br>
                          over my feeble axes and drew the graph,<br>
                          named it hyperbola and told me <br>
                          that he was half a <br>
                          hyperbola and I was <br>

                          infinity, approaching but never crossing <br>
                          the rivers of our mothers' grudges <br>
                          or roads blistered with the weight of <br>
                          Poles fleeing<br>

                          grisly fur of the Russian bear. <br>
                          But he didn't care for <br>
                          history's shackles <br>
                          and dared to broach the idea of <br>

                          Rage rocked him--he knew <br>
                          the distance between our vertices<br>
