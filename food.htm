            <font size="2">The Stuyvesant lunchroom's head chef, Andreas Skouras, 
            has been bustling through from the kitchen to the serving lines to 
            the oversized ovens and refrigerators behind the scenes in the section 
            of the cafeteria unknown to most of Stuyvesant's students for more 
            almost ten years. He arrives at school everyday at 7:00 AM and checks 
            each type of food for their proper temperatures in each respective 
            refrigerator. At 7:30, Skouras' two assistants arrive to begin preparation 
            for the day's cooking. The salads are tossed, the tomatoes are sliced 
            and the sandwiches wrapped and another day of Stuyvesant lunch begins.<br>
            <br>
            Skouras is one 
            of the many staffers who pull together to provide the Stuyvesant community 
            with school lunch. In addition to the workers, the lunchrooms' inner 
            workings and the rules of the 5th floor area that feeds the Stuy populace 
            have largely been taken for granted.<br>
            <br>
            There are five periods of lunch in the Stuyvesant schedule. While 
            many students choose to go out for lunch, patronizing local restaurants 
            and businesses, many remain to dine at Stuyvesant's cafeteria. <br>
            <br>
            The cafeteria offers three lines from which to buy lunch. &quot;Here, 
            we have 3 different stations,&quot; explains Skouras. &quot;One is 
            the fast food where we have hamburgers cheeseburgers, pizzas, Jamaican 
            patties and french fries. The third station is the cold cuts, all 
            sandwiches.&quot;<br>
<br>
            Skouras continues. &quot;We have the middle station which is the special 
            of the day which can be anything.&quot; Together, with the manager, 
            Skouras is the man largely responsible for the choice of special of 
            the day and the style in which it is served. According to the head 
            chef, the middle station provides different foods from the cafeteria 
            food norm and offers better nutrition.<br>
            <br>
            The choices Skouras makes for the middle station, which usually is 
            the most popular of the three lunch lines, depends on a &quot;beat&quot; 
            provided by the Board of Education. The &quot;beat&quot; is a list 
            of foods that the Board approves of for student consumption. Every 
            6 months, certain foods are taken off and others are added. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;I like the middle line because they have the most interesting 
            food,&quot; says senior John Mangual. &quot;It varies from day to 
            day and that's better than having just a hamburger every day.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Some students believe the quality of food at Stuyvesant to be better 
            than that of other schools. Senior David Chernikovsky said, &quot;The 
            food isn't bad. Its better than my junior high school's.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Skouras agrees. &quot;The quality of the food is much better. This 
            doesn't mean that the other schools have [bad] food, no. This is an 
            elite school and we have to treat our students better than other schools.&quot; 
            Skouras provided an example of how the Stuyvesant lunch, despite being 
            on the same beat of food choices as all other schools, could be of 
            higher quality. &quot;I cannot buy anything else except what the Board 
            of Education allows. But I can enhance the food. The Board of Education 
            says I have chicken patties. They bring me the chicken patties but 
            the manager and I decide we are going to strip the chicken, add sauce 
            and make chicken teriyaki,&quot; the chef explained. &quot;It's the 
            same menu, but it's differently prepared.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Even with all the styles in which Stuyvesant serves its food, all 
            of the meals meet strict Board of Education nutrition requirements.<br>
            &quot;Not too much salt, not too much butter, everything has to be 
            to standards of temperature,&quot; said Skouras. &quot;We have to 
            have a fresh batch [of offerings of items like salad] every period.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Another element of the lunchroom environment is the actual cafeteria 
            itself. Managing a lunch period and the mass of rowdy students is 
            not an easy task says Virginia Adams, a lunchroom monitor.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;[Students] leave their tables messy, they throw stuff around, 
            they play cards, they're very disruptive,&quot; says Adams, who monitors 
            the cafeteria for three periods. &quot;What they need in the cafeteria 
            is more than two people. Kids come into one exit and go out another. 
            They sneak food out. While you're on the east side [monitoring], they're 
            on the west side doing what they want. Its a bit too much.&quot;<br>
<br>
            According to Assistant Principal Steven Satin, approximately 600 students 
            are in each lunch period, in this school of about 3000 students and 
            five lunch periods.<br>
            <br>
            Oneida Freeman, the monitor of condiments or known by students as 
            the &quot;ketchup lady&quot;, testified to the behavior of students 
            in the cafeteria. &quot;Some of them are nice, some aren't. Some are 
            courteous, some will say thank you, and some won't. Some are good 
            students, some are kids.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Many students do not follow the guidelines for the number of ketchup 
            packets allowed per student. &quot;The rule is four ketchups. Some go 
            by the rule and some don't,&quot; says Freeman, who has worked at 
            Stuyvesant for nine years. &quot;The manager made the rule. If you 
            don't [follow the rule], you'll run out by the end of the day.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In addition to managing the ketchup, the salad dressings, and the 
            salad bar, Freeman also cleans tables. The cafeteria's tables are 
            constantly cleaned during the lunch periods. &quot;During the day 
            you use sanitizing solution,&quot; says Freeman. &quot;And at the 
            end of the work day you scrub the tables down.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Despite the lunch staff's hard work in preparing school lunches and 
            cleaning after students, many students opt to buy food outside of 
            school. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Usually its just more convenient for me,&quot; says junior Janet 
            Hseuh, &quot;because I usually have work to do [during my lunch period] 
            and I can take my food with me. But in the cafeteria, they give you 
            a hard time about that.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            For some students, the food in the cafeteria does meet their tastes.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The quality of the food [at Terry's] is much better,&quot; says 
            senior Damani Taylor. &quot;The cafeteria food is cheap and like an 
            army surplus but it doesn't taste that great.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Kids have to understand that its better to eat here than to 
            go across the street to pay 5, 6 dollars to have a meal which is less 
            nutritious, high in cholesterol, high in carbohydrates,&quot; says 
            Skouras. &quot;They have a meal here for a dollar or less, with the 
            salad, the fruit, the condiments, and everything is prepared to the 
            standards of nutrition.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Junior Stacy Tse agrees. &quot;For a dollar you can't get anything 
            better.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Stuyvesant's chef does his best to please Stuyvesant's hungry. On 
            days where there is excess food, Skouras decides to let students who 
            have the last lunch period be offered extra amounts of food. Skouras 
            enjoys his job, explaining &quot;If you don't take pride in your job, 
            don't do it.&quot; However, just like Stuyvesant students are notorious 
            for their dealings with high levels of stress, Stuyvesant's lunch-workers 
            are prone as well.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;It's a lot of work because we have to feed over a thousand kids 
            and its a lot and lot of stress,&quot; says Skouras.</font></font>
