              of homosexuality and 23% said that they would feel uncomfortable 
              sitting next to a gay or lesbian student in class. In the wake of 
              the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, 
              tolerance and education have been frequently visited topics in Warren

              grades challenged the results. The other freshman ticket, that of 
              Scott Burr and Annie Chen, called into question the allegedly improper 
              enforcement of election rules and said that contracts and charters 
              had never been given to the candidates. The losing sophomore ticket 
              (Rona Luo and Christina Alfonso) said that their opponents had campaigned 
              aggressively within 30 feet of the election tables, which is against

              from his website on May 17 after two weeks of confrontation with 
              teachers who were upset by the contents of the evaluations. Students 
              had been able to post anonymous evaluations on the site, which had 
              sections for writing comments and areas to rate teachers; He said 
              the site received about 200 hits a day. At a faculty meeting on

              rally for a pay contract at City Hall on May 17. New York City teachers

              PA Votes to Sue Board of Education<br>
              By THERESA LANGSCHULTZ<br>
              In a vote of 161 to 84, parents present at a Parents' Association 
              meeting voted to sue the Board of Education for insufficient action 
              regarding air quality issues at Stuyvesant. At stake were improved 
              filters and the relocation of the barge; some parents said the Environmental 
              Protection Agency was not testing for enough substances, and had 
              not adequately cleaned the school in the first place. Board of Education 
              officials responded that the air was safe.<br>

              Hundreds of Stuyvesant students joined high school and college students 
              citywide in a walkout to protest proposed budget cuts. Principal 
              Stanley Teitel faulted the walkout for being during school hours, 
              necessitating cutting. That didn't stop an estimated 1,200 students 
              from leaving school. </font></p>

              Rules restricting campaign materials, specifying elections procedures, 
              and detailing grounds for candidate removal governed primary elections 
              for Student Union President and Vice President and senior caucus. 
              The Board of Elections created the rules to even the playing field, 
              but some SU members felt they went too far.</font></p>
