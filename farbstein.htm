              With Steven Edward Farbstein, Biology Teacher</font></b><br>
              <b>conducted by BENJAMIN MAGARIK<br>
              <br>
              Spectator: How long have you been teaching? What have you taught?</b><br>
              Farbstein: Thirty-seven years. I've taught biology, history of science, 
              philosophy, Advanced Placement psychology, and chemistry. I even 
              taught Biology in Yeshiva. I lasted three weeks. I couldn't stand 
              the kids.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Do you like psychology? </b><br>
              Farbstein: I used to like psychology. I don't like it much anymore. 
              It bores me.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: How do explain the popularity of A.P. Psychology?</b><br>
              Farbstein: One reason is that people want to know who they are. 
              What they find out when the class is over is that they still don't 
              know who they are. As Jung [Carl Jung, Swiss Psychologist and partial 
              disciple of Freud] said &quot;you step out of the fog and ask 'who am I?'&quot; While I'm figuring out who I am, I can get a high 
              grade.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Who is the most interesting person you've met in your 
              time at Stuyvesant?<br>
              </b>Farbstein: I can't answer that. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Anybody ever stand out? </b><br>
              Farbstein: One kid stands out. It's a sad story. The Biology Department 
              used to call him &quot;the turtle boy.&quot; He was an expert on 
              turtles. World class, a scholar. His mother was a schizophrenic, 
              his father was abusive. He had a naive, sweet personality- he was 
              just a really sweet kid. He disappeared from school and he was spotted 
              in the East Village, living on the street. He joined a vampire cult--[where] 
              they bite each other and drink each others' blood. [sighs] A real 
              waste of a human being&#133; a waste of potential. He was so smart.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What's teaching like these days?</b><br>
              Farbstein: I'm getting bored. I have a desire to move on.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Favorite staff Member?</b><br>
              Farbstein: I don't have any favorite staff members&#133;Mel Kane 
              [former Biology teacher, retired]. One of the few people who has 
              a creative life force. And Anne Moehle [Former Biology and Psychology 
              teacher, retired]: a great teacher.<br>

              What's your opinion of cafeteria food?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Farbstein: I think if they served that in Riker's Island there'd 
              be a riot. They serve you hockey pucks, chicken crappola.<br>
              <b><br>

              What do you think of Stuyvesant students?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Farbstein: It's a very diverse group. Someone once told me that 
              &quot;if you told them to jump, they'd ask how high?&quot; That's 
              not something I'd say [about them].<br>

              </b></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spectator: 
              If you were a Stuyvesant student, where would you apply to college?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Farbstein: I'd go to UCLA. You can hang out on the beach, enjoy 
              the climate, it's aesthetically pleasing, there's good instruction, 
              and it doesn't cost that much. If you're a little looser, cruise 
              with Santa Cruz.<br>

              <b>Spectator: In a sentence or less, what are your thoughts on the 
              state of the public education in New York City?</b><br>
              Farbstein: The Second Law of Thermodynamics<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What, if any, is the role of knowledge in Stuyvesant? 
              </b><br>
              Farbstein: 
              Knowledge is a function of the brain. In the Kabbalah, [Jewish mystical 
              text] they say feeling is a function of the heart. The goal is wisdom 
              when knowledge fills the heart. There 
              ain't no wisdom in Stuyvesant.</font></p>

                  my first class. I didn't know that there was a warning bell 
                  and I walked into Ms. Lorenzo's room while she was teaching 
                  in front of all these juniors and seniors. I was like 'I have 
                  to go,' but she pulled me back into the class and started introducing 
                  me to everyone and talking in French.&quot;<br>
