            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When 
              arthritis has attacked our joints and gray hairs have sprung up 
              on our heads, we may find ourselves looking back on our high school 
              years, trying to use whatever we've kept to remind us of those years 
              of youth and beauty. Given the near omnipresence of music in our 
              lives these days, songs are now as nostalgia-inspiring as snapshots. 
              The opening notes of a song or the bridge in a ballad can bring 
              waves of memory back as quickly as an old letter or even a Polaroid 
              of best friends on a beach. What follows is a year by year breakdown 
              of songs to listen to when, in the dimness of a study, hunched over 
              a dusty scrap book, you get the urge to remember what it sounded 
              like to be young too. <br>

              Any AP Statistics student will tell you that it's tough to rank 
              anything in absolute terms when you have such a big population to 
              sample from. This is never more true than when trying to rank things 
              like songs or bands. That said, however, the factor that usually 
              sheds light on the choices made by whoever's In Charge is the context 
              in which the things are ranked. Stuyvesant is, despite its traditions 
              of studiousness and success, still a high school. And for all the 
              intelligence and all the accomplishments, we are still growing up, 
              and we need our share of anthems, ballads, and silly love songs. 
              We also need to stay abreast of trends. The lists and rankings will 
              be based on personal taste(one or two picks per list will be Critic 
              Picks chosen by yours truly), rankings by Billboard and the ARC 
              Top 40, and a general memory of what got the most heads nodding 
              or hips swaying at parties or in houses. And now, without further 
              ado, we begin with freshman year, and the first List...<br>

              Year(1998-1999)</u><br>
              As smaller, more awkward versions of what we are now streamed into 
              Stuy, rock n' roll was in a kind of strange limbo. Thanks to the 
              unexpected staying power of hip-hop radio stations like Hot 97, mainstream 
              radio and television were slowly starting to warm up to the idea 
              of introducing hip-hop to their rotations. While pop still reigned 
              supreme on the charts, rock's secondary position was threatened 
              by radio friendly hip-pop icons like Will Smith, whose <i>Big Willie 
              Style</i> was still selling copies a year after its release and rap's 
              newly crowned first lady Lauryn Hill's <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn 
              Hill</i> was on its way to becoming a hip hop gemstone. Meanwhile, in 
              the kingdom of pop, the recent Stateside success of the Backstreet 
              Boys led the pop factory Jive Records to take a chance and unveil 
              a dangerously similar group called 'N Sync. Many laughed. Others 
              grimaced. But no one seemed to notice that the tide was turning. 
              In September that year, Marilyn Manson's fourth album had screamed 
              that rock was dead. As it turned out, Manson declaration wasn't 
              wrong. It was just ahead of schedule. </font><br><br>

              <u>Sophomore Year(1999-2000)</u><br>
              The increased workloads. The new (but fake) millennium. Y2K. Oddly 
              enough, the presence of all these ominous things didn't seem to 
              phase pop music, which grew brighter and sweeter with every passing 
              month. From his pulpit in Times Square, Carson Daly heaped boy bands 
              and girly crooners onto America in TRL's Top Ten, and the sales 
              war between the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync became very real. Even 
              Britney was faced with a little piece of competition named Christina 
              Aguilera. Rap kept itself in the spotlight two ways: flash artist 
              Jay-Z teamed with pop icon Mariah Carey in a move that helped both 
              parties, while DMX kept it real with rough tales of the ghetto. 
              Meanwhile, mainstream rock had entered a wintry quiet, a kind of 
              hibernation it would remain in until the coming summer. Nine Inch 
              Nails' incredible <i>The Fragile</i> didn't make it on the radio, and after 
              a surprising #1 debut on the Billboard 200, it quickly plummeted. 
              KoRn had ceased to be important, and rock's former champions like 
              U2, Metallica, and the Foo Fighters were all either on tour, between 
              albums, or busy rearranging themselves. N&uuml;-metal would make 
              a play for pop's throne at the end of the year, but until it did, 
              our second year in Stuy belonged to the pop stars. </font><br><br>

              <u>Junior Year(2000-2001)</u><br>
              In a year where the biggest efforts were required just to keep our 
              heads above water academically, pop took unprecedented control of 
              the charts. Rather than try to fight with rap and R 'n B for control 
              of MTV and Billboard, producers and artists simply began to melt 
              the three rival genres together. Hotshot producers like Timbaland 
              and the Neptunes began working for people like Britney Spears, Jennifer 
              Lopez became J-Lo (and oh how we laughed), Destiny's Child became 
              a Z100 staple, and the synthesis was on. Meanwhile, on the second 
              and third tiers of the Billboard charts, music had become exciting 
              again. Three huge records exploded out of England, but by the time 
              they got across the pond, and after the shock of a number one debut 
              for Radiohead's Kid A had worn off, the youth media moved on. But 
              Stuyvesant didn't. As some fans mourned the apparent demise of OK 
              Computer's guitars, others took heart and rejoiced in the arrival 
              of Coldplay and Travis, two UK products that had taken a page out 
              of Radiohead's old play book, with differing degrees of success. 
              Others cheered the return of female rock and roll goddesses Fiona 
              Apple and PJ Harvey. Still others roared with happiness as Rage 
              Against the Machine showed the n&uuml;-metal movement how it should 
              be done one last time. By the year's end, as everybody stormed out 
              of the Physics Regents, it was clear to everybody that greater, 
              the best, lay ahead. </font><br><br>

              <u>Senior Year(2001-2002)</u><br>
              The biggest and most stressful year in our Stuy careers also featured 
              some of the most entertaining musical occurrences. Mainstream rock 
              had found a new champion in Train, whose &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; 
              rocketed up the singles charts and by the summer's end, most people 
              could be seen singing or nodding along every time it came on the 
              radio. Thanks to Dan Nakamura, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, a 
              band made up of cartoon characters went on tour. Other highlights 
              included a nu-metal album that featured not a single curse word, 
              a pop metal album that screamed about coke, groupies, and the prison 
              system all at once, and a seventeen year old wunderkind who elevated 
              R 'n B by getting behind a piano and letting herself out. Rock 
              had lost some of the academic steam it had built up the year before, 
              and nu-metal sparked back to life. As second term arrived, and we 
              grew our closest before we would finally scatter, the music went 
              on, just as we would: different, and still growing.<br>
