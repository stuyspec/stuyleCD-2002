              What is Third world? A club? Gang? Fraternal Society? Association?</b><br>
              M: Crew of friends that turned into family of friends.<br>
              K: What I think, is that when people see us in the school, they 
              have an image- a bunch of brown kids. We're not that. We've got 
              Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Atheists, and even 
              a Buddhist.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What is the club's purpose? What activities does 3W 
              engage in?</b><br>
              M: The club is an outlet for the crew to be organized.<br>
              K: An outlet from stress at Stuyvesant. We set goals. Sophomore 
              year, we wanted to increase the club's cumulative average by a point. 
              We succeeded.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: By how many points?</b><br>
              K: 1.96. That's thirty people.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Do you ever get into any inter-gang/club fights?</b><br>
              K: Beef is bad.<br>
              M: Anytime we do get into beef, we try to kill it. If there's a 
              problem with one of us, there's one with all of us.<br>
              K: But don't get me wrong, it's not like we want to fight. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Tell me about your website.</b><br>
              M: We've had more than one. The reason we have the website is so 
              that when people leave the school, the memories remain.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Some contend that your club is unnecessarily exclusive, 
              creating an elite social clique. How do you respond to this?</b><br>
              M and K, at the same time: It's true<br>
              K: It's not like I walk around thinking &quot;that kid is a herb, 
              let's keep him out of the club.&quot; People with us who are chill 
              with us.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What's it like having such a strong circle of friends 
              in school?</b><br>
              M: We're all friends with each other, but when it comes down to 
              personal matters, you deal with it how you deal with it. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Those are hot shirts. What's with the nicknames?</b><br>
              K: All I know is &quot;QB FLASH.&quot; That's all I'm gonna say.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: That's Ravi, right? [Ravi Pathak, senior] What's behind that? </b><br>
              K: He lives in Queensbridge, and &quot;flash&quot; comes from the 
              fact that he used to run from thugs.<br>
              M [laughing]: He still does. <br>
              K: So, he's Flash Gordon. Cause you know, he used to get robbed 
              mighty. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: How did the administration react to Third World?</b><br>
              K: None of my concern.<br>
              M: No need for comment.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: Do you think Stuyvesant is a good environment for 
              members of 3W?</b><br>
              M: Stuyvesant is what made Third World.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Spectator: What's in the future for Third World?</b><br>
              M: Sophomores and Alumni&#133;<br>
              K: And juniors.</font></p>
