            <b>by JEFF DELAUTER<br>
            <br>
            </b>It is rare when an issue raised in <i>The Spectator</i> fails to elicit 
            at least one response from some reader within the Stuyvesant community, 
            be it a student, a teacher, a parent, or an alumnus. Some topics of 
            concern, however, not only elicit a response, but spark written debates 
            on the Opinions pages that last for several issues. At least two such 
            discussions have occurred in the past four years: cheating and censorship.<br>
            <br>
            In the December 6, 1999 issue, Opinions writer Tim Von Hollweg brought 
            to light the New York City Board of Education's disturbing practice 
            of blocking students' Internet access in &quot;Warning: Access Denied.&quot; 
            According to Von Hollweg, &quot;The plan implemented by the city, 
            which involves creating a general word filter that denies access to 
            all pages containing the word 'sex,' would essentially make it impossible 
            to search for anything from gamecocks to Middlesex county.&quot; He 
            warned Stuyvesant students that although &quot;our school trusts students 
            enough to allow us free reign on the Internet,&quot; we were in fact 
            &quot;condemning ourselves to a more limited environment by taking 
            advantage of the system.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In January 2000, three poems sponsored by the Writing on the Wall 
            club were posted in a designated space in the building. Administrators 
            demanded that the three poems be removed from the wall because they 
            contained sexually explicit language. In the January 16, 2000 <i>Spectator</i>, 
            an editorial entitled &quot;What We Really Learn From Censorship&quot; 
            criticized Principal Teitel and the administration for forcing Stuyvesant 
            creativity to be &quot;sterilized and purged of all honesty and emotion,&quot; 
            and for &quot;deciding to circumvent Writing on the Wall's faculty 
            advisor, Katherine Fletcher.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In the same issue, Eugene Oh and Steven Blau wrote a piece entitled 
            &quot;Not All Writing Belongs on the Wall&quot; which argued that 
            &quot;Graphic imagery does not belong on the school walls.&quot; Oh 
            and Blau contended it was the responsibility of the administration 
            &quot;to provide a safe and comfortable learning environment for all 
            students,&quot; by removing &quot;any content, no matter how artistically 
            valid, they feel inappropriate for the entire Stuyvesant community.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Junior Shari Abrams wrote a letter entitled &quot;Writing Does Belong 
            on the Wall&quot; in response to Oh's and Blau's piece, saying that 
            she had &quot;never seen anyone force anyone else to read any of the 
            pieces posted on the walls of our school.&quot; Abrams also expressed 
            her resentment of Oh's and Blau's statement &quot;Stuyvesant students 
            hold nothing more sacred than the freedom to do whatever they want, 
            whenever they want,&quot; saying that she respected the views of her 
            fellow students and does so &quot;on a basis of whether or not I feel their opinions are valid.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Cheating plagued Stuyvesant long before our arrival at the school 
            and will be problematic long after we graduate. During our years here, 
            many have used <i>The Spectator</i> to voice their concerns and to propose 
            their solutions. In &quot;Against (Multiple) Choice,&quot; Robert 
            Lindquist argued that Scantron tests did not accurately assess students' 
            understanding of the material taught in classes. &quot;Let's address 
            that the Scantron facilitates the revolting practice of cheating. 
            We must eliminate the Scantron form and the multiple-choice test. 
            They allow for dishonesty and are unfairly harsh.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In response, Candace Nuzzo defended the use of Scantrons in the October 
            9, 2000 article &quot;The Upside of Scantrons.&quot; According to 
            Nuzzo, &quot;Multiple choice tests are the most logical form of testing 
            for a school like Stuyvesant. Fill-ins and long answers could not 
            cover all the required material in the manner that multiple-choice 
            ones do. Getting rid of multiple choice tests will in no way solve 
            these problems.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Douglas Goetsch's February 1, 2001 article entitled &quot;Cheating 
            at Stuy: What Goes On&quot; provided a teacher's very extensive analysis 
            of the academic honesty problem at our school. Goetsch wrote that 
            while cheating is a way of life at Stuyvesant, &quot;with more sanity 
            and less stress around here, our students can rise to academic challenges 
            without resorting to cheating.&quot; Goetsch cited extraneous busy-work 
            and number grades as two unanimous influences to cheat. He also directly 
            criticized our school's &quot;obsessive preoccupation with college 
            admissions,&quot; and &quot;daily announcements over the loud speakers 
            haranguing seniors about college deadlines and forms.&quot; Goetsch 
            asserted that it is not the job of Stuyvesant teachers to get students 
            into college, remarking that &quot;When students behave like walking 
            college applications, they cheat, they brown-nose, they contest grades, 
            they lose their love of learning, and they forfeit their character.&quot; 
            Goetsch proposed a switch to letter grades and the establishment of 
            an honor code to remedy Stuyvesant's insidious cheating problem.<br>
            <br>
            In a February 13, 2001 letter to the editor, College Advisors Carol 
            Katz and Pat Cleary rebuffed Goetsch: &quot;Our College Office does 
            not determine the college admissions process. He has implicated the 
            wrong institution. We would be doing our students a disservice by 
            making them less competitive than their peers at other schools.&quot; 
            The two writers stressed that it was time to &quot;tackle the real 
            issues rather than making one office a scapegoat (an office that is 
            replicated in every high school in the United States) is counterproductive 
            to students and faculty.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In the same February 13, 2001 issue Class of 1997 alumnus Meghan Norling 
            expressed her amazement that the cheating problem at Stuyvesant had 
            not improved since she had graduated. Currently a student at Haverford 
            College, she candidly discussed the benefits of an honor code and 
            her own academic transgressions at Stuyvesant: &quot;I cheated at 
            Stuyvesant. I'll admit it. I couldn't have gotten through a certain 
            semester of physics without my graphing calculator and friends in 
            the third period class. But I cheated because I felt that I had to.&quot; 
            Norling also criticized the use of multiple-choice tests &quot;taken 
            straight from the textbook,&quot; and stressed the importance of learning 
            for learning's sake and not for grades.<br>
            <br>
            In &quot;Testing Encourages Cheating,&quot; (March 7, 2001) writer 
            Ben Magarik took a more radical stance on Stuyvesant's problem. He 
            claimed: &quot;Testing alienates students. How many great lessons 
            and discussions have been instantly ruined when teachers mention the 
            'T' word? The simplest answer is to reduce our school's emphasis on 
            examinations.&quot; Magarik added that students often respond responsibly 
            and actively to assignments such as oral presentations, essays, and 
            creative projects. &quot;Let's lower the number of mandatory exams 
            from seven to four, while carefully monitoring those test that are 
            given. Less testing as well as new methods of evaluation will eliminate 
            or reduce the feelings of estrangement.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            These two conflicts clearly display the valuable role of an unbiased 
            student publication in discussing school affairs. </font></p>
